        handleClient(connection) is the function that handles each client connection. It reads data from the client using 
        connection.recv(1024) (the 1024 specifies the maximum number of bytes to be received at once), converts the received 
        bytes to a string using .decode(), and then sends back the modified data (converted to uppercase) using connection.
        send(modified_message.encode()). If the client sends the message "exit", the function breaks out of the while loop and 
        closes the connection using connection.close().
